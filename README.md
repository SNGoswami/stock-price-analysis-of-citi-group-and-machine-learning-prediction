# stock-price-analysis-of-citi-group-and-machine-learning-prediction
In this project, we have carried out stock price analysis of the citi group's stocks for the past five years. We have also carried out predictions for the performance of the stock using machine learning.
In order to perform our task, we have followed a structured roadmap. The steps which have been taken are as follow:
- Importing the libraries needed for our analysis and development of machine learning models while installing the ones which are not available.
- Data collection from Yahoo Finance and getting an overview of the fetched dataset.
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis after getting an overview of our dataset.
- Performing Financial Analysis once making our data ready to use. In which we have performed analysis of historical trends, volatility, trading volumes, return analysis and getting technical indicator values.
- Next up we have performed Feature engineering machine learning.
- Now, we have developed our machine learning models to carry out predictions.
- In this step we have written code to develop comprehensive visualisation of our analysis and predictions.
- At last, we will be calling all the functions and executing them in order to get the results.
By following all the aforementioned steps, we got an understanding of how the stock of citi group has performed in the mentioned timeline and where it can go in the future.
